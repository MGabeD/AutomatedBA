Identify natural language phrases that indicate a data retrieval request, such as "show me the sales figures for last quarter" or "I need information on employee attendance." Map these phrases to the SQL SELECT statement structure, interpreting 'sales figures' and 'employee attendance' as column names and 'last quarter' as a WHERE clause condition based on date ranges.
